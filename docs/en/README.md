## Overview

SKT is an all-in-one IoT platform engineered for efficiency, scalability, and real-world performance. Originally designed for chillers and pellet boilers, SKT has been successfully tested for:

- **Room Temperature & Humidity**
- **Object Temperature** (e.g., pipes)
- **Electric Current**
- **Smoke Detection**

As we continue to innovate, additional sensors and custom configurations will be added to meet specific client needs. SKT leverages robust connectivity—including LoRa for long-range communication, and 4G (with SIM card support) for remote area deployments—while using MQTT to securely manage data in ThingSpeak.
